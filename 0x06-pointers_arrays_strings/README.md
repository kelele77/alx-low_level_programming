Pointers allow to use dynamic memory allocation.
What is pointer to string in C? A C string is nothing but an array of characters, so a pointer to a string is a pointer to an array of characters. And a pointer to an array is the very same as a pointer to its first element. The string is basically bounded from the place where it is pointed to ( char *ptrChar; ), to the null character ( \0 ). What is a array in C? Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. ... All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations.
